    Problem 11.1 (S) Which of the following statements are true?
        a. The height of a binary search tree with n nodes cannot be
        smaller than O(log n).
        b. All the operations supported by a binary search tree (except
        OutputSorted) run in O(log n) time.
    Problem 11.2 You are given a binary tree with n nodes (via a
    pointer to its root). Each node of the tree has a size field, as in
    Section 11.3.9, but these fields have not been filled in yet. How much
    time is necessary and sufficient to compute the correct value for all
    the size fields?
        b. O(n)
